                  CRISP-8: A portable SDL [S]Chip-8 emulator                 
===============================================================================

   Crisp-8 is a small project spawned from the mind of a bored developer, its
sole purpose of existence is giving me something to waste away a few hours 
while doing something mildly productive. There's no guarantees that this will
work, theres no guarantee that this won't explode you, your computer, your
home and even your cat to bits, and I won't be liable to any damage resulting
from you getting frustrated with the awful code therein or any damage resulted
from actually running this code.
   With that being said, this has been, and continues to be a fun learning
experience, and I hope you enjoy the results of this side-project.

   [please, remember that this is currently in development, and thus it might
change drastically, and is likely to contain bugs, and is even more likely that
more will be introduced in the future. I am -NOT- liable for any damages to
the mind of those who venture themselves in reasoning with my logic, and 
neither am I liable to damages caused by the use of this code or anything
generated from it.]

   The code is licensed under the GNU GPLv2, feel free to study and take bits
from this code. Feel free to contribute and/or port it. It's free.
